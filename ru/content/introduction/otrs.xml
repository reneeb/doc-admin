    <para>
    OTRS can be installed on many different operating systems. OTRS can run on
linux and on other unix derivates (e.g. OpenBSD or FreeBSD). You can also
run it on Microsoft Windows. OTRS does not have excessive hardware
requirements. We recommend using a machine with at least a 2 GHz Xeon or
comparable CPU, 2 GB RAM, and a 160 GB hard drive for a small setup.
    </para>

    <para>
    To run OTRS, you'll also need to use a web server and a database server.
Apart from that, you should install perl and/or install some additional perl
modules on the OTRS machine.  The web server and
<application>Perl</application> must be installed on the same machine as
OTRS. The database back-end may be installed locally or on another host.
    </para>

    <para>
    For the web server, we recommend using the <application>Apache HTTP
Server</application>, because its module mod_perl greatly improves the
performance of OTRS. Apart from that, OTRS should run on any web server that
can execute Perl scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
    You can deploy OTRS on different databases. You can choose between
<application>MySQL</application>, <application>PostgreSQL</application>,
<application>Oracle</application>, or <application>Microsoft SQL
Server</application>.  If you use <application>MySQL</application> you have
the advantage that the database and some system settings can be configured
during the installation, through a web front-end.
    </para>

    <para>
    For <application>Perl</application>, we recommend using at least version
5.8.8. You will need some additional modules which can be installed either
with the Perl shell and CPAN, or via the package manager of your operating
system (<application>rpm</application>, <application>yast</application>,
<application>apt-get</application>).

        Если для установки OTRS используются бинарные пакеты, собраные специально
под вашу операционную систему, то все необходимые модули языка Perl уже
включены. Если нет, - используйте менеджер пакетов вашей операционной
системы (например (rpm, Windows-Инсталлятор) для установки всех необходимых
модулей.

            To use OTRS, you'll be OK if you use a modern browser with JavaScript

            We recommend always using the latest version of your browser, because it has
the best JavaScript and rendering performance.  Dramatical performance
varieties between the used browsers can occur with big data or big systems.
We are happy to consult you on that matter.

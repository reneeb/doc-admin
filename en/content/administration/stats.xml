<title>Statistics</title>

<para>
The OTRS statistics module holds features to track operational statistics and generates custom reports associated with OTRS usage. The OTRS system uses the term "statistic" generically to refer to a single report presenting various indicators.
</para>
<note>
    <para>
        For <ulink url="https://www.otrs.com/solutions/"><emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution™</emphasis></ulink> customers, there is also a reports generator available. Here "report" refers to a collection of several statistics in one PDF document that can be easily configured and automatically generated and distributed. Please find more details in the <ulink url="http://otrs.github.io/doc/manual/otrs-business-solution/stable/en/html/index.html"><emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution™</emphasis></ulink> manual.
    </para>
</note>

<para>
Proper configuration of the OTRS statistics module is associated with a multitude of requirements and considerations. These include the various OTRS modules to be evaluated, user permission settings, indicators to be calculated and their complexity levels, ease of configuration of the statistics module, speed and efficiency of calculations, and support of a rich set of output variants.
</para>

<para>
Statistical elements, i.e. files which supplement the functionality of the statistics module for specific requirements, can be integrated for calculating complex statistics.
</para>

<section id="stats-usage" >
<title>Handling of the module by the agent</title>

<para>
When signed on as an agent, the statistics module can be opened by selecting "Reports" and then "Statistics" in the main menu.
</para>

<section id="stats-overview" >
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
    Selecting the "Statistics" link in the navigation bar, and then the submenu link "Overview", calls up the Overview screen. The Overview screen presents a list of all pre-configured reports the agent can use (see Figure below).

    </para>

    <para>
    When the statistics module is installed, it comes preloaded with a few sample statistics imported into the system. These are shown as a list on the overview page. If the overview list extends to more than a single page, the agent can browse through the different pages. The list of statistics can be sorted as desired, by clicking the desired column header in the list. To generate a particular statistic, click on the statistic's "Run now" link.

<title>Edit / New</title>

<para>
Agents with write rights can edit an existing report configuration by calling up the edit user interface of the statistics module. Alternately, they may create a new report. The associated screens can be reached in the following manner:

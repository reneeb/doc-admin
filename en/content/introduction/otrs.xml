        <title>Hardware and software requirements</title>

        <para>
        OTRS can be installed on many different operating systems. OTRS can run on
        linux and on other unix derivates (e.g. OpenBSD or FreeBSD).
        OTRS does not have excessive hardware requirements. We
        recommend using a machine with at least a 2 GHz Xeon or comparable
        CPU, 2 GB RAM, and a 160 GB hard drive for a small setup.
        </para>

        <para>
        To run OTRS, you'll also need to use a web server and a database server.
        Apart from that, you should install perl and/or install
        some additional perl modules on the OTRS machine.
        The web server and <application>Perl</application> must be installed on the same machine
        as OTRS. The database back-end may be installed locally or on another host.
        </para>

        <para>
        For the web server, we recommend using the <application>Apache HTTP Server</application>, because
        its module mod_perl greatly improves the performance of OTRS. Apart from that,
        OTRS should run on any web server that can execute Perl scripts.
        </para>

        <para>
        You can deploy OTRS on different databases. You can choose between <application>MySQL</application>,
         <application>PostgreSQL</application>, <application>Oracle</application>, or
        <application>Microsoft SQL Server</application>.
        If you use <application>MySQL</application> you have the advantage that the database
        and some system settings can be configured during the installation, through a web front-end.
        </para>

        <para>
        For <application>Perl</application>, you will need some additional modules which
        can be installed either with the Perl shell and CPAN, or via the package manager of your operating system
        (<application>rpm</application>, <application>yast</application>,
        <application>apt-get</application>).

                We recommend always using the latest version of your browser, because it has the best JavaScript and rendering performance.
                Dramatical performance varieties between the used browsers can occur with big data or big systems.
